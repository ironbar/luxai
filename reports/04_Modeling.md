# Modeling

## Select modeling technique

<!---Document the actual modeling technique that is to be used. If multiple
techniques are applied, perform this task separately for each technique.
Many modeling techniques make specific assumptions about the dataâ€”for example,
that all attributes have uniform distributions, no missing values allowed,
class attribute must be symbolic, etc. Record any such assumptions made. --->

**TODO:** I will go back to this point once I have created some hand-made agents and
I have a better understanding of the game.

## Generate test design

<!---Describe the intended plan for training, testing, and evaluating the models.
A primary component of the plan is determining how to divide the available dataset
into training, test, and validation datasets.

Doing a plot of score vs train size could be helpful to decide the validation strategy

Depending on the size of the data we have to decide how we are going to use submissions.
The less the submissions the most confidence we can have on the score. However sometimes
the data distribution is very different, or the size of the data is small and we have
to make a lot of submissions. Sometimes is not easy to have a good correlation between
validation score and LB score

## Iteration 1. Rule based agent

<!---
The work is done using short iterations. Each iteration needs to have a very
clear goal. This allows to gain greater knowledge of the problem on each iteration.
--->

### 1.1 Goal

The goal is to identify the difficulties when making a rule based agent

### 1.2 Development

On a first step I'm going to start from the simple agent and make it better incrementally. All the work can be found on notebook `002_hand_made_agent`. I have refactorized the simple agent and later done the following updates:

1. Add research
2. Build new workers
3. Build new cities
4. Avoid collisions

With this I have created the first agent called `viral` that builds cities and workers as fast as possible.

#### 1.2.1 Ideas for improving the agent

### 1.3 Results

The agent `viral` scores around 974 on leaderboard, which is around position 100 on the leaderboard.
This agent beats the `simple_agent` around 94.5% of the times.

## Iteration n. Iteration_title

The work is done using short iterations. Each iteration needs to have a very
clear goal. This allows to gain greater knowledge of the problem on each iteration.
