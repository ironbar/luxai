# Data Preparation
<!--- --->
## Select Data
<!---Decide on the data to be used for analysis. Criteria include relevance to
the data mining goals, quality, and technical constraints such as limits on data
volume or data types. Note that data selection covers selection of attributes
(columns) as well as selection of records (rows) in a table.
List the data to be included/excluded and the reasons for these decisions.--->
## Clean Data
<!---Raise the data quality to the level required by the selected analysis techniques.
This may involve selection of clean subsets of the data, the insertion of suitable
defaults, or more ambitious techniques such as the estimation of missing data by
modeling. Describe what decisions and actions were taken to address the data
quality problems reported during the Verify Data Quality task of the Data
Understanding phase. Transformations of the data for cleaning purposes and the
possible impact on the analysis results should be considered. --->
## Construct Data
<!---This task includes constructive data preparation operations such as the
production of derived attributes or entire new records, or transformed values
for existing attributes. --->
## Integrate Data
<!---These are methods whereby information is combined from multiple tables or
records to create new recordsor values. --->
## Format Data
<!---Formatting transformations refer to primarily syntactic modifications made
to the data that do not change its meaning, but might be required by the
modeling tool. --->
