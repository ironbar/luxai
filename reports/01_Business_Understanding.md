## Challenge description

<!--- Look at the challenge description, understand the goal of the challenge
and write it here with your own words. Use images if they improve the explanation--->

> The Lux AI Challenge is a competition where competitors design agents to tackle a multi-variable optimization, resource gathering, and allocation problem in a 1v1 scenario against other competitors. In addition to optimization, successful agents must be capable of analyzing their opponents and developing appropriate policies to get the upper hand.

## Evaluation

<!--- Understand the metric used on the challenge, write it here and study
the characteristics of the metric --->

> Each day your team is able to submit up to 5 agents (bots) to the competition. Each submission will play Episodes (games) against other bots on the ladder that have a similar skill rating. Over time skill ratings will go up with wins or down with losses and evened out with ties.

<!--- --->

> At the conclusion of 360 turns the winner is whichever team has the most CityTiles on the map. If that is a tie, then whichever team has the most units owned on the board wins. If still a tie, the game is marked as a tie.

## Assess situation

<!---This task involves more detailed fact-finding about all of the resources,
constraints, assumptions, and other factors that should be considered in determining
the data analysis goal and project plan

* timeline. Is there any week where I could not work on the challenge?
* resources. Is there any other project competing for resources?
* other projects. May I have other more interesting projects in the horizon?
 --->

I will be going two weeks on holidays from 25 September and around 10 days from 26 November. So instead
of having 3 months for the challenge I will be having slightly more than 2 months.

Moreover I will be missing on the last days of the challenge. Thus I need to have in mind that I need to
end the challenge before the other participants.

I don't currently have other project competing for resources.

### Terminology

<!--- Sometimes the field of the challenge has specific terms, if that is the
case write them here, otherwise delete this section.--->

## Project Plan

<!--- Write initial ideas for the project. This is just initial thoughts,
during the challenge I will have a better understanding of the project and
with better information I could decide other actions not considered here.--->

### 1. Understand the game

I need to deeply understand the game previously to deciding the approach. To do so I will start by
designing an agent by hand. This will help to find where machine learning could be applied.
